:uri-rel-file-base: link:
:uri-getting-started: {uri-rel-file-base}doc/getting-started.adoc

This repository gives you all the resources to quickly develop and test Jenkins Pipeline jobs in Docker containers:

* a Jenkins2 instance configured out-of-the-box in a Docker container
* a CI agent configured to execute Pipeline jobs on your host in Docker containers
* a Git Server and Web UI (Gogs) to locally save your Global Pipeline Libraries
* *No Docker In Docker*!

To setup this environment in 5 minutes, just read the {uri-getting-started}[Getting Started Guide].
